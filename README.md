# Visa Status Checker Project Summary

## Project Idea
Create a user-friendly web application that allows visa applicants to easily check their visa application status and receive important information about their application.

## Key Features

1. Status Check:
   - Users enter their IRL (Indian Resident Label) number and visa application date.
   - System displays the current status of their visa application (Approved, Rejected, or Pending).

2. Working Days Calculation:
   - Calculate and display the number of working days that have passed since the application date.

3. Automated Email Notifications:
   - Send congratulatory emails for approved visas.
   - Send supportive emails for rejected visas.
   - Inform applicants via email if their application is still pending.

4. User-Friendly Interface:
   - Simple and intuitive web page for entering details and viewing results.

5. Real-Time Updates:
   - Provide up-to-date information on visa application statuses.

## Workflow

1. User visits the website and enters their IRL number and application date.
2. System checks the database for the visa application status.
3. If found, the system calculates the number of working days since the application date.
4. The status and working days information is displayed to the user.
5. Simultaneously, an automated email is sent to the applicant based on their status:
   - Approved: Congratulatory message
   - Rejected: Supportive message with potential next steps
   - Pending (or not found): Information about the pending status and any required actions

This application aims to simplify the visa status checking process, provide valuable information to applicants, and keep them informed through automated communications.
